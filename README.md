# Using Supervised Machine Learning to Predict IPEDS Graduation Rates

### Goal:
* Run Linear Regression Models and Decision Tree Models on IPEDS data to predict graduation rate. These results will act as our basaeline.
* Use Genetic Algorithm to find the most relevant features.  Rerun our supervised algorithms using just these features.
* Run as play with classifying (high, med, low)
* Feature Engineering vs NN
